# Context

:::{note}
```python
from leads import *
```
:::

This is where the magic happens. It is the representation of the vehicle in code.

```{py:class} leads.Context
:private-members: __init__
```

## Create a [`Context`](#leads.Context)

We provide an event-oriented child implementation of [`Context`](#leads.Context): [`LEADS`](#leads.LEADS)

```{autoclass} leads.LEADS
:private-members: __init__
```

```python
from leads import LEADS
```
