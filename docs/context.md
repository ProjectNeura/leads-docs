# Context

:::{note}
```python
from leads import *
```
:::

This is where the magic happens. It is the representation of the vehicle in code.

```{py:class} leads.Context
:members:
:show-inheritance:
```

## Create a [`Context`](#leads.Context)

We provide an even-oriented child class of [`Context`](#leads.Context): [`LEADS`](#leads.LEADS)

```{py:class} leads.LEADS
:members:
:show-inheritance:
```

```python
from leads import LEADS
```
