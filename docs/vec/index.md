# LEADS VeC

The [VeC Project](https://www.villanovacollege.org/giving/vec-project) is the main intended application of LEADS. LEADS
VeC initially served for this target. Yet
throughout the development, it has become an indivisible part of LEADS. It works as the bootloader of LEADS, providing a
template of how to make use of the framework.

To get started, read [this](https://github.com/ProjectNeura/LEADS) first.

For customization, you would replace the [devices module](leads_vec.devices) or even the [main module](leads_vec.cli).
See [here](https://github.com/ProjectNeura/LEADS?tab=readme-ov-file#specify-a-devices-module).
