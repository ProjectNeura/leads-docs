# Safety Instructions

> **Driving is a privilege - not a right**

LEADS is a powerful assistant, but not a driver. LEADS cannot guarantee the safety of any person or thing, nor can it
assume any responsibility for any accidents that may occur. In any case, the user must have full control of the vehicle
at all times, including but not limited to: looking forward, holding the steering wheel with both hands, and keeping the
right foot in a position to brake at any time.

## Carriers of LEADS VeC

### Seat belt and Roll Cage

Unless specific excuses, all vehicles equipped with LEADS VeC must have a five-point harness as well as a roll cage.

### Hardware-level Emergency Filing

LEADS VeC cannot control the hardware design of the vehicle. However, the user must ensure that there is a hard
connection between the brake caliper and the brake pedal, and between the throttle pedal and the motor that cannot be
disconnected. This is to prevent loss of control in scenarios where the controller SBC is unavailable due to accidental
sabotages including power failure, short circuit, or sensor error.

## Before Start

### Security Check

Before starting and driving the vehicle, the user must carefully inspect the vehicle to ensure that all the
above-mentioned design requirements are met and are still intact.

After starting the vehicle, check the fault lights and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to view the console logs and eliminate
suspicious errors and warnings.

### Functionality Check (Optional)

Functionality check must be performed when a new version of LEADS VeC is installed.
